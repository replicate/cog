# Test that cog exec works with PTY for simple commands
# This is a simpler variant that just tests echo works

# Run echo command with PTY (no input needed)
# cog exec builds from current directory and runs the command
pty-run /dev/null cog exec echo "hello from cog exec"
stdout 'hello from cog exec'
