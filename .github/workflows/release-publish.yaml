name: Release Publish

# Triggered when a draft release is published (manual approval step)
# The release-build workflow creates draft releases on tag push.
#
# REQUIRED GITHUB CONFIGURATION:
# 1. Create environments in Settings → Environments:
#    - "pypi": For PyPI publishing
#    - "crates-io": For crates.io publishing
#
# 2. Configure environment protection rules:
#    - Deployment branches: "Selected branches and tags"
#    - Add pattern: v* (to restrict to version tags only)
#    - Required reviewers: Add maintainers (only maintainers can publish)
#
# 3. Add secrets to each environment:
#    - pypi: Uses OIDC (no secret needed with Trusted Publisher)
#    - crates-io: CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN
#
# SECURITY:
# - Only maintainers can publish releases (via environment protection rules)
# - Secrets only available for v* tags (via environment branch restrictions)
# - Cannot be triggered from branches, only from published releases
#
# PUBLISH ORDER:
# 1. coglet → PyPI (must be first, SDK depends on it)
# 2. coglet → crates.io (can run parallel with SDK)
# 3. SDK → PyPI (depends on coglet being available)
# 4. CLI binaries → GitHub Release (no dependencies)
