name: Release Publish

# Publishes coglet to PyPI and crates.io when a release is published.
# SDK publishing is handled by pypi-package.yaml (triggered after this completes).
#
# REQUIRED GITHUB CONFIGURATION:
# 1. Create environments in Settings → Environments:
#    - "pypi": For PyPI publishing (Trusted Publisher for coglet)
#    - "crates-io": For crates.io publishing
#
# 2. Configure environment protection rules:
#    - Deployment branches: "Selected branches and tags"
#    - Add pattern: v* (to restrict to version tags only)
#
# 3. Add secrets:
#    - crates-io: CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN
