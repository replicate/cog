name: Release Publish

# Publishes all packages when a release is published (manual approval step).
# The release-build workflow creates draft releases on tag push.
#
# PUBLISH ORDER:
# 1. coglet → PyPI (must be first, SDK depends on it)
# 2. coglet → crates.io (parallel with coglet PyPI)
# 3. SDK → PyPI (after coglet, via pypi-package.yaml reusable workflow)
#
# REQUIRED GITHUB CONFIGURATION:
# 1. Create environments in Settings → Environments:
#    - "pypi": For PyPI publishing (Trusted Publisher)
#    - "crates-io": For crates.io publishing
#
# 2. Configure environment protection rules:
#    - Deployment branches: "Selected branches and tags"
#    - Add pattern: v* (to restrict to version tags only)
#
# 3. crates-io uses Trusted Publishing (OIDC via rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action)

  # SDK publishing is handled by pypi-package.yaml (separate workflow,
  # same release trigger). It polls PyPI for coglet before publishing.
