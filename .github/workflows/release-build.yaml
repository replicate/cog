name: Release Build

# Triggered on version tags to build release artifacts and create draft release.
# A separate person must then publish the draft release to trigger release-publish.yaml.
#
# FLOW:
# 1. Developer pushes tag (e.g., v1.0.0)
# 2. This workflow builds all artifacts and creates a draft GitHub release
# 3. Different team member reviews and publishes the draft release
# 4. release-publish.yaml triggers and publishes to PyPI/crates.io
#
# SECURITY:
# - Tag must be on main branch (verified in verify-tag job)
# - No secrets needed - only builds artifacts and creates draft

  push:
    tags: ["v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+*"]
