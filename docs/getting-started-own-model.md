# Getting started with your own model

This guide will show you how to put your own machine learning model in a Docker image using Cog. If you haven't got a model to try out, you'll want to follow the [main getting started guide](getting-started.md).

## Prerequisites

- **macOS or Linux**. Cog works on macOS and Linux, but does not currently support Windows.
- **Docker**. Cog uses Docker to create a container for your model. You'll need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) before you can run Cog.
- **Python 3.7 or greater**. Cog currently supports all active branches of Python: 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10.

## Initialization

First, install Cog if you haven't already:

```sh
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/cog -L https://github.com/replicate/cog/releases/latest/download/cog_`uname -s`_`uname -m`
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cog
```

To configure your project for use with Cog, you'll need to add two files:

- [`cog.yaml`](yaml.md) defines system requirements, Python package dependencies, etc
- [`predict.py`](python.md) describes the prediction interface for your model

Use the `cog init` command to generate these files in your project:

```sh
$ cd path/to/your/model
$ cog init
```

## Define the Docker environment

The `cog.yaml` file defines all the different things that need to be installed for your model to run. You can think of it as a simple way of defining a Docker image.

For example:

```yaml
build:
  python_version: "3.8"
  python_packages:
    - "torch==1.7.0"
```

This will generate a Docker image with Python 3.8 and PyTorch 1.7 installed, for both CPU and GPU, with the correct version of CUDA, and various other sensible best-practices.

To run a command inside this environment, prefix it with `cog run`:

```
$ cog run python
✓ Building Docker image from cog.yaml... Successfully built 8f54020c8981
Running 'python' in Docker with the current directory mounted as a volume...
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Python 3.8.10 (default, May 12 2021, 23:32:14)
[GCC 9.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
```

This is handy for ensuring a consistent environment for development or training.

With `cog.yaml`, you can also install system packages and other things. [Take a look at the full reference to see what else you can do.](yaml.md)

## Define how to run predictions

The next step is to update `predict.py` to define the interface for running predictions on your model. The `predict.py` generated by `cog init` looks something like this:

```python
import cog
from pathlib import Path
import torch

class Predictor(cog.Predictor):
    def setup(self):
        """Load the model into memory to make running multiple predictions efficient"""
        self.net = torch.load("weights.pth")

    # Define the input types for a prediction
    @cog.input("input", type=Path, help="Image to enlarge")
    @cog.input("scale", type=float, default=1.5, help="Factor to scale image by")
    def predict(self, input, scale):
        """Run a single prediction on the model"""
        # ... pre-processing ...
        output = self.net(input)
        # ... post-processing ...
        return output
```

Edit your `predict.py` file and fill in the functions with your own model's setup and prediction code. You might need to import parts of your model from another file.

You also need to define the inputs to your model using the `@cog.input()` decorator, as demonstrated above. The first argument maps to the name of the argument in the `predict()` function, and it also takes these other arguments:

- `type`: Either `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, or `Path` (be sure to add the import, as in the example above). `Path` is used for files. For more complex inputs, save it to a file and use `Path`.
- `help`: A description of what to pass to this input for users of the model
- `default`: A default value to set the input to. If this argument is not passed, the input is required. If it is explicitly set to `None`, the input is optional.
- `min`: A minimum value for `int` or `float` types.
- `max`: A maximum value for `int` or `float` types.
- `options`: A list of values to limit the input to. It can be used with `str`, `int`, and `float` inputs.

For more details about writing your model interface, [take a look at the prediction interface documentation](python.md).

Next, add the line `predict: "predict.py:Predictor"` to your `cog.yaml`, so it looks something like this:

```yaml
build:
  python_version: "3.8"
  python_packages:
    - "torch==1.7.0"
predict: "predict.py:Predictor"
```

That's it! To test this works, try running a prediction on the model:

```
$ cog predict -i input=@input.jpg
✓ Building Docker image from cog.yaml... Successfully built 664ef88bc1f4
✓ Model running in Docker image 664ef88bc1f4

Written output to output.png
```

To pass more inputs to the model, you can add more `-i` options:

```
$ cog predict -i input=@input.jpg -i scale=2.0
```

In this case it is just a number, not a file, so you don't need the `@` prefix.

## Using GPUs

To use GPUs with Cog, add the `gpu: true` option to the `build` section of your `cog.yaml`:

```yaml
build:
  gpu: true
  ...
```

Cog will use the [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker) base image and automatically figure out what versions of CUDA and cuDNN to use based on the version of Python, PyTorch, and Tensorflow that you are using.

For more details, [see the `gpu` section of the `cog.yaml` reference](yaml.md#gpu).
